I recently dug out my old dusty raspberry pi 4 from my old boxset. I was craving for a project, and since I got a decent laptop, I lost all use cases for the emulatorbox that the Raspi was originally inteded to be. I then decided to turn the raspi into a Pi-Hole, to block out nasty advertisements from my home network, regardless of the device in use. After that, the project spiraled further, I added Unbound for DNS handling. 

After doing that, I wanted to do more. At first I was thinking about making a home server for media, but I realized I don't really use any other devices for media, only my PC. So instead I decided to spur up a small website, which you are looking at right now.

I also lifted at the gym. I did some squats.
